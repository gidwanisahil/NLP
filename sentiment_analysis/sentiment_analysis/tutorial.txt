Sentiment Analysis Tutorial
1. What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a series of words. It’s commonly applied to analyze customer feedback, social media conversations, and more, categorizing sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral.

2. Project Overview
In this project, we’ll build a simple sentiment analysis model using Python. We’ll use:

Pandas to handle data.
Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms.
CountVectorizer to convert text into numerical data.
Naive Bayes classifier for training our model.
3. Project Structure
Your project will have the following structure:

kotlin
Copy code
sentiment_analysis/
│
├── data/
│   └── sentiment_data.csv
│
├── notebooks/
│   └── sentiment_analysis_notebook.ipynb
│
├── scripts/
│   └── sentiment_analysis.py
│
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
4. Setting Up the Environment
Create a New GitHub Codespace:

Go to your GitHub repository and create a new Codespace.
Set Up Your Files:

Create the folders and files as outlined in the project structure above.
Create the Dataset:

In the data/ folder, create a file named sentiment_data.csv and add sample text data with their corresponding sentiments.
Example Data:

csv
Copy code
text,sentiment
"I love this product!",positive
"This is the worst experience ever.",negative
"Okay, not bad.",neutral
Install Required Packages:

Create a requirements.txt file with the necessary packages:
Copy code
pandas
scikit-learn
nltk
seaborn
matplotlib
Install the packages by running:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Understanding the Code
Loading Data: In scripts/sentiment_analysis.py, we load the CSV file using Pandas:

python
Copy code
def load_data(filepath):
    df = pd.read_csv(filepath)
    return df['text'], df['sentiment']
Preprocessing Data: The text data needs to be converted into a numerical format. We use CountVectorizer for this:

python
Copy code
def preprocess_data(texts):
    vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
    X = vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)
    return X, vectorizer
Training the Model: We’ll train a Naive Bayes classifier on our processed text data:

python
Copy code
def train_model(X_train, y_train):
    model = MultinomialNB()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model
Evaluating the Model: After training, we evaluate the model’s performance using accuracy and a classification report:

python
Copy code
def evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test):
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    print("Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
6. Running the Program
To run the sentiment analysis program:

Open a terminal in your Codespace.
Navigate to the scripts directory:
bash
Copy code
cd scripts
Run the Python script:
bash
Copy code
python sentiment_analysis.py
You should see an accuracy score and a classification report printed to the terminal, giving you insights into how well the model performed.

7. Exploring Further
Jupyter Notebook:

Open notebooks/sentiment_analysis_notebook.ipynb to visualize the sentiment distribution and further explore your data interactively.
Enhancements:

Consider using more complex models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or even deep learning models with libraries like transformers for improved performance.
You could also explore larger datasets for a more robust analysis.
Conclusion
You now have a basic sentiment analysis program set up! This project is a great introduction to natural language processing and machine learning concepts. Feel free to customize and expand upon this foundation as you continue your learning journey. If you have any questions or need help with specific parts, just ask!
